# World of Atoms

This is a game project of mine about rebuilding your own world, solar system, cluster and eventually universe. I can't say exactly what will be included in the game yet, since I haven't figured it out myself yet. I will add my list of ideas eventually, but for now things will be in development for a while.

# Many thanks to the mentioned below

This project would not have been possible without the help of MrEliasen@Github, sharing his knowledge to us all!

**Link github:** https://github.com/MrEliasen
**Link Twitch:** https://www.twitch.tv/sirmre

The main reason I got stuck at his channel @Twitch, is because I was stuck in my own project with a Node.js server/client based game. I was browsing the web and Twitch for knowledge, a sensei I could admire and learn from. Then I found Mr.E, trying to answer my stupi... special questions (to be honest, I don't even know myself what I tried to ask 80% of the time).

It was storage related is what I know, then I came off as knowing nothing about PDO/MySQL (didn't want to mention my 10~ years of eperience there) and it was around this point I just stopped typing in the chat (felt missunderstood, bullied (I wasn't) and just felt crap). I also reminded myself: "Chris, you know that you have mental conditions, don't let your social struggles hinder you". Stayed on his channel because he seemed like me, just more knowledge and not overweight (also nice with a fellow bald person). Been creeping on his channel and Discord ever since.

So, before I insult my sensei, he have helped so much, just existing doing his things. I started by pulling big chunks from his project into a test project of mine, ended up with not knowing as much as I wanted so started from scratch, writing line by line with Mr.E's projects as a guideline of what libraries I could get help from.

The content of this repository (8th of April, 2018) is where I am now since I found Mr.E (10th of March, 2018). 

## So what have I learned during this time (28 days / 4 weeks)?

General:
> * Don't copy (copy + paste), rather write it yourself line by line and learn what you type. Google everything new/weird
> * Git
> * Linux (removed Windows, because **censored** that!)
> * Setting up and saving my local development environment, while also working with the global environment

Development:
> * **Libs:** React, dom, router, redux, saga, bootstrap, axios, babel, eslint, loaders, webpack, bluebird, dotenv, express, helmet, jsonwebtoken, passport, sequelize, uuid, bcrypt
> * Knowledge about the interaction between server and client
> * ES6, SASS
